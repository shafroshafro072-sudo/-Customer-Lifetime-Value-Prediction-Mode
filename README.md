Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Model
#Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using machine learning techniques. CLV helps businesses estimate the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their lifetime. Accurate CLV prediction enables better marketing strategies, customer retention planning, and revenue forecasting.

#Objective
Analyze customer purchase behavior

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

Build a machine learning model to predict Customer Lifetime Value

Evaluate model performance

Generate business insights from predictions

#Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning modeling

Jupyter Notebook

#Project Workflow
#Data Loading
Imported dataset

Checked data types and structure

Handled missing values

#Data Preprocessing
Removed duplicates

Converted date columns to datetime format

Feature scaling (if required)

Encoded categorical variables

#Feature Engineering
Created customer-level metrics such as:

Recency

Frequency

Monetary value

Aggregated transactional data

Model Building
Split data into training and testing sets

Applied regression model (e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest)

Trained the model on customer features

#Model Evaluation
Evaluated using:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

#Results
Successfully predicted Customer Lifetime Value.

Identified key factors influencing high-value customers.

Model performance evaluated using regression metrics.
